# Electromagnetic Braking Simulation for a Free-Fall Ride
This is an electromagnetic braking simulation in **MATLAB** designed for a free-fall ride based in the Biot Savart Law and Lenz Law. The brakes will operate electromagnetically using perpendicular waves that will assist in stopping the game platform. These brakes operate without necessarily relying on electricity, allowing them to continue operating even in the event of a power outage.

These operate according to Lenz's law. They work in such a way that, when a conductor passes through a magnetic field generated by an electromagnet, a force opposite to the movement of the conductor is created, decelerating the object until it finally stops. The Biot-Savart law describes the magnetic field generated by a current in a conductor. It helps analyze how induced currents generate braking forces, essential to stopping the fall safely.

## Project features
* The code calculates the position (Px, Py, Pz) and differential lengths (dx, dy) for each current element in the loop using angular steps.
* Using the Biot-Savart law, the code computes the magnetic field (dBx, dBy, dBz) at each point in space, accounting for the contributions of each differential element of the current loop.
* Nested loops iterate through space grid points (I, J, K) and loop elements (L) to compute the field at each point.
* The magnetic field vectors are visualized using quiver3, while the magnitude of the magnetic field is plotted using pcolor.
* Plots a simulation of the magnet falling through the magnetic field created by the loop.
* Plots showing the magnetic force versus position and the magnet's position over time (with and without magnetic forces).
* The code calculates the EMF induced in the loop as the magnet falls through the field, based on the change in magnetic flux.
